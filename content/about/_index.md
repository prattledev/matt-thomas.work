# About Me

I’m **Matt Thomas**, an **Audio and Communications Engineer** with over **15 years of experience** in broadcast engineering. I specialise in the **planning, design, integration, and configuration** of complex audio and comms systems for broadcasters where **mission‑critical reliability** is essential and failure isn’t an option.

My career has taken me to some of the **world’s most demanding live events**, including major football tournaments, global elections, and the **Olympic Games**. I thrive in high‑pressure environments, collaborating with engineering and production teams to deliver **high‑availability, world‑class systems** that perform flawlessly when it matters most.

I work at the intersection of **broadcast** and **IT**, believing strongly in the shared engineering principles that underpin both fields. Earning my **Cisco CCNA certification in 2020** expanded my ability to deploy and maintain advanced audio and communications solutions that meet modern, evolving technical standards.
